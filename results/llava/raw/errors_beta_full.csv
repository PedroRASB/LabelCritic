The left side of the image represents the right side of the human body. The liver region in the image should be marked in red, using an overlay. However, I am not sure if the red overlay correctly or incorrectly marks the liver. Please following these instructions:

1. Check if the red region is coherent with the expected shape and location of a liver.Show your reasoning in the answer.
2. After checking, you should give an final judge in the end of your answer, substituting _ by Good or Bad:

The liver is typically located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, and it is not visible in the red-marked area. The red overlay seems to be marking a different structure, possibly the right kidney or part of the right lung.
