The gall_bladder is typically located on the right side of the body, near the liver. In this image, the red overlay is on the left side of the body, which would correspond to the liver. Additionally, the shape of the red overlay does not match the typical shape of a gall_bladder, which is usually more rounded and oval-like.

The red overlay in the image seems to follow this general shape and is positioned in the upper abdomen, which is consistent with the expected location of the stomach.
